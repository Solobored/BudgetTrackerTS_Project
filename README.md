# BudgetTrackerTS

BudgetTrackerTS is a Budget Tracker application built for **CSE 310 – Applied Programming (Module #2: TypeScript)**.  
It demonstrates TypeScript types, DOM manipulation, localStorage persistence, filtering, and basic UI/UX design.

## Features
- Add income and expense transactions with category, notes, and date.
- Edit or delete transactions (prompt-based editing in this simple demo).
- Filter transactions by category and date range.
- Live summary showing total income, total expenses, and balance.
- Data stored in browser localStorage (no server required).

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. No build step required — `app.js` is included and ready to run. `app.ts` is provided as the TypeScript source file.
3. Add transactions and try filters. Data persists automatically.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `app.ts` — TypeScript source (for learning & inspection)
- `app.js` — compiled JavaScript (browser runtime)
- `README.md` — this file
- `Module_Submit.md` — submission checklist and time log

## Notes
- This project includes both a `.ts` source file and a precompiled `app.js` so it runs in the browser without any build tools.
- All functions include comments in `app.ts`. The JS file is readable and works directly.
